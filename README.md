# JavaScript Documentation Page â€” [Live Demo](https://davidagredano.github.io/javascript-documentation-page)


This web development project was a personal project aimed at building a complete website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **CSS Structure**: I have used the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology for structuring my CSS. This allows for a more modular and maintainable approach to styling.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive on mobile, tablets and desktops. I have included a hamburger menu button that shows and hides the menu on small screens.
- **Clean Code**: I have kept the code clean and organized throughout the project. I used Prettier to format my code and ensure consistency in my coding style.
