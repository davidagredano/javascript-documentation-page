This web development project was a personal project aimed at building a complete website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It is a good showcase of my current _(February 2023)_ skills and knowledge on front-end development.

## CSS Structure

I have used the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology for structuring my CSS. This allows for a more modular and maintainable approach to styling.

## Responsive Design

The website is designed to be responsive on mobile, tablets and desktops. I have included a hamburger menu button that shows and hides the menu on small screens.

## Clean Code

I have kept the code clean and organized throughout the project. I used Prettier to format my code and ensure consistency in my coding style.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
